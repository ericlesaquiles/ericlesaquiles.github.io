# Papert's problem of learning

How is it that learning takes place, in a most fundamental level, at
least for us humans (an, presumably, for other animals as well)? 

That's obviously an important question if you are (as so many seem to
be as of lately) interested in making inteligent machines - machines
that are able to do more of the stuff that we are able to.

But, and this might be less obvious, it's important for many, many
other reasons as well. It is, or should be, an essential question for
anyone interested in performing any work other than completely
repetitive work or, put another way, anyne interested in living a
"genuine life", whathever that may be. 

And that should be essentialy everybody - or so Seymour Papert argues
in his [Mindstorms](https://mindstorms.media.mit.edu/). 

That, by the way, is one of the best and worst titles I've come
across: it hardly sounds like a serious book title; and yet, it has an
appeal to a younger public that is possibly what he meant in the
first place (and might explain how LEGO appropriated from it); also,
it's hard to think of a "good" title for this sort of work.

Before talking about an author's work, I often find it useful to have
an idea of their background. So, here's a brief overview of Papert's background:

1. Papert attended the University of Witwatersrand, receiving a
   bachelor in arts and philosophy;
2. Followed by 2 doctorates in mathematics followed by another doctorate in mathematics;
4. Followed by several research positions, in many places throughout
   Europe;
5. Importantly (for us, here) he spent some time working with Piaget,
   on the development of enfants;
6. And then later at MIT, as, among other things, the co-director of
   the AI Lab, co-creator of (what would later be called) the MIT Media Lab, and
   professor of math and education.
   
That gives an idea of what he did, but also may help to ground some of
what he "preached", namely that **education is a permanent process**:

> One shouldn't separate education from practice

## A primer on Piaget's (and Papert's) learning theory

Piaget studied the development of children, has written books and is
most remembered for that. On that he noticed many interesting
phenomena, and came with explanations for those phenomena, that came
to ground what can be called a *theory of learning*, that is the **constructivism**.

Actually, Piaget can be said to take part on the broader intelectual tradition of
*structuralism*, which some say he just renamed (or *rebranded*)
constructivism for political reasons, but never mind that. We will
talk about **constructivism** here.

The idea is of constructivism is pretty simple

1. People have what can be called *constructions* on their heads;
2. Those constructions can also serve as construction blocks and;
3. In order to learn anything, we make use of those blocks, by
   combining them in different ways or what have you

Importantly, **(1) learning is a process of construction** and **(2)
one can only construct with tools previously acquired**. 

One I thought of that, it seemed to me a pretty reasonable, almost obvious, idea,
acercely worth spelling. But from that sprout many ideas about the
nature of learning, as well as what the better learning environment
could be.

That is something greatly taken up by Papert[^constructionism]. He spend a good
amount of his energy on trying to improve education conditions, and
improve the idea of what a "good" educational condition is like.

In particular, he strongly argued computers can offer a great platform
for learning (only not the way it's perhaps most commonly used, to
*program* the kids - rather, he would have the kids program the
computer). For that, he (not by himself, of course) developed the
[LOGO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGPu2HSSAco) programming environment,
featuring a turtle, that came to become a sort of symbol for other
learning platforms as well (see
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTd3N5Oj2jk) why it was a
really good choice). LOGO deserves a post for itself though,
so we leave furthuer discussion for another time.

Back to the learning environment (with in or out the computer):
Importantly, it should encourage active engagement in a **community of
learning, in a playful manner**.

Playing is important because it's a great way of obtaining new construction
blocks, as well as finding new ways of using old ones. And playing
(understood in a wider sense) in a community is a great way to
motivate the creation and using said constructions.

This takes to a point to something worth stressing: **the "best
learning" doesn't occur in a banking model**.

## Freire's[^freire] banking model of education

I've been giving only sort of a rough sketch of Papert's (and, by
extension, Piaget's) learning ideas, trying to touch in only a few of
the core ideas, but this one should be clear: **learning doesn't work
like depositing packets in a bank**.

![Cat in bank](/assets/img/Cat-in-bank.png "cat in bank")
*Yes, I know... We all hope I can learn to draw better*

That is an analogy drawn by Paulo Freire, in what he called the *banking
model of education*, that is, regretfuly, the model of education most
in use in most schools. The idea there is that learning somehow works
by someone *better* (say, a teacher, or other adults) depositing
"packets of knowledge" in the learner's minds. In that sense, each one
would be somewhat like a bank, with stores of knowledge, and the role
of school would be fill those stores.

If there is one idea to take from here (be it from Papert, Piaget,
Freire) is: **that's not how learning works**. Which is one reason
most schools are so terrible, or rather, so good in shunning people
away from learning - the banking model of learning is a means for
domination, not for education.

That's not to say one can't learn stuff from people trying to stuff
them with extraneous information, it's just that it's not *really* the
*people trying to stuff them with extraneous information* that is
effecting the learning, but rather a construction process.

In order for a construction process to occur there must be in the
learner's mind previous constructs from which to build new ones and,
importantly, the motivation to use those constructs so as to build new
ones. And the banking model of education addresses none of those
points.

Now, one could have come with the constructs from somewhere else, and
could have got from somewhere else the motivation to use those
"packets of knowledge" in order to build their own. In that case, it
could work, but the point is that when that system works, it's for a
contingent reason. 

But that system wasn't really built[^schools] for learning. Think
about it,

> if someone just keeps telling you stuff that's not really
related to you, or to anything you care about, and somehow links your
worth, or grades you, by how much you could take of that, does that sound like
education to you? More like an education proper to slaves, it seems.

## The Juggling Procedure

That was mostly about how or what education isn't, but what about what
it *is*? As Papert said, "one can't talk about learning without
talking about learnig about something", and so, in a try to exemplify
some ideas of a learning process, I draw on the *learn to juggle*
example (mostly taken from a section in the forementioned Mindstorms).

Now, there are many kinds of juggling, but we'll be focusing in the
cascade one (in constrast to, for instance, the "shower" kind of
juggling)

![cascade-shower](/assets/img/Juggler.png "Juggler")

If you're interested in juggling and you go by that "banking model of
education" briefly discussed above, you should expect to face many
difficulties and to have an overall frustrating experience until you
finally "get it". 

That's because you'd see that skill as a sort of "packet" that you
just don't have, until you do. A constructivist, on the other hand,
sees the learning more as a process (like "constructing"), and understands there might be
different steps on the process, and thus might be better equipped to
observe the process and "debug" it when something doesn't quite work
out.

That, by the way, is a reason why Papert argued computers can be so
good for learning, so for acquiring new (and powerful) mental
constructions: 

- by programming, we build a *process*;
- one can more easily learn to isolate different parts of
  the process, and to name them (in what is usually called
  "procedures" or "functions" in programmign languages);
- and thus, by abstracting away details that are already understood, one
  literally has more pieces available to create even more complicated and
  interesting processes.
  
We can materialize that as a "people procedure" for the case of juggling.

The goal is to come up with a *procedure* "**To-Juggle**".

As a first step, we identify and name subprocedures that might helps
us achieve that goal. For us, natural candidates seem to be
"**Toss-Right**" and "**Toss-Left**" (in a more real situation, just
*what* might be those subprocedures might not be straightforward, but
we're streamlining things a bit for the purpose of this post).

*Toss-Left* is a command to throw a ball from the right hand and catch
it with the left hand, and *Toss-Right* a command to throw a ball with
the left and catch with the right hand.

Tossing balls from one hand to another is simple enough that most
people can do with little practice, so we can concentrate in how to
combine those procedures to get *To-Juggle*.

Timing here is essential, and the procedures for tossing balls are to
be performedd in parallel, rather then serially one after the
other. To deal with that parallelism, one comes with the concept of
"When" - what Papert calls "When Demon", and in computer parlance
could be called "When Daemon". The "Demon" or "Deamon" is to stand for
something that is usually "sleeping", or just not-acting, until some
conditions are satisfied, and they do something. Many things could be
modelled with those "When Daemons", like, "When hungry, eat" and so
on.

For *To-Juggle* we'll use two *When Daemons*, namely *When something
Toss-Left" and *When something Toss-Right", where "*something*" stands
for some condition we'll have to fill in.

These conditions we'll call "*Top-Right*" and "*Top-Left*". Top left,
stands for the following state (and *Top Right* for the analogous one)

![Top-left](/assets/img/Top-left.png)

With that, we get our full procedure:

```
	To Keep Juggling
	When Top-Right Toss-Right
	When Top-Left Toss-Left
```

## Using the Juggling Procedure as a learning tool

How can we the above procedure as a tool for learning? Having
identified a seemingly suitable procedure, the following natural step
is trying to apply it, and then debugging when it doesn't work.

For that purpose, we might want a more granular procedure. For
instance, we want to first be sure that the person can toss just 1 ball from
one hand to another. 

Then, we'll want to be sure that she can
combine 2 tosses, so to cross 2 balls from both hands. That might not
work immediately. One common "bug" in the procedure is that people are
used to following the balls with the eyes when tossing, which besides
being confusing when there are 2 or more balls involved, makes it hard
to discern the *Top-Right* and *Top-Left* conditions.

In order to "debug" that, one comes back to tossing just 1 ball, and
making sure one doesn't follow it with the eyes, focusing just in the
point at the top of the trajectory instead. That is usually not
difficult and most people don't have a problem with that after
identifying the behavior.

Now, before going on, just a brief note about this "debugging" we're
doing. The term "bug" might have too much of a heavy baggage, and be
associated with overall bad feelings, but in our setting we still use
the term, for lack of a better one, but we strip it of it's
weight. The thing is people are generally conditioned to label their
actions as "right" or "wrong", "good" or "bad", but here we find it
silly to come with an arbitrary criterion of "good" or "bad" and,
instead, by seeing learning as a process, we understand that it can go
on and perfect itself. And this is arguably the most important type of
learning, namely **learning of learning**, so debugging isn't here to
"turn something bad into something good" (although it might do that as
well), but rather as an instance of the **learning to learn** process.

After one can cross 2 balls, a third may be introduced. Some more
debugging might be needed, but by following the procedure outlined
above, you shouldn't take too long before being able to be juggling
around :)

Note that if instead one would follow a "*brute force*" approach, just
getting three balls and trying to juggle them, it would probably take
much longer. Not only that, but one would probably learn much less in
the process - eventually, one would get it, but it would be much
harder to make any debugging.

As Papert says, 
> People are capable of learning like rats in mazes. But the process
> is slow and primitive. We can learn much more and more quickly by
> taking concious control of our learning process, articulating and
> analyzing our behavior.

If you don't quite have the balls to do it, you could try with lemons
;) - just keep in mind they rot much quicker after knocking a few
times.

[^constructionism]: Papert's "philosophy or learning" might be seen to emphasize different points to those of Piaget's, so instead of *constructivism* it's reffered to as *constructionism*.
