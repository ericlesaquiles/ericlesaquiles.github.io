# Are you just solving logic problems?

When one mentions "logic", I'd wager for most people what comes to mind are
those "fun little logic problems", that are usually word problems
where one has to "use logic" to solve a situation. And here, "use
logic" usually denotes that no special knowledge or acquaintance with
special theories of special fields are required - and then, upon
grasping the problem, usually stated in our good old ordinary
language, proceed by "pure reasoning" to solve it. 

Also, most "educated people" would have an idea that, well, you could
formalize the procedure, exchange words for symbols and then perhaps
automatize at least some parts of the ordeal, but all that with no
fundamental change in understanding - that is, those symbols are
supposed to only formalize our natural languge anyway, so that is no
really big difference.

And then with that sort of understanding, people may perhaps be a
little surprise when hearing there is such a thing as "research in
logic" - for weren't the fundamental principles known since, like
Aristotle? Or, they might think, that's all really about solving logic
problems - peharps some more complicated and tricky ones than the ones
they're used to.

But no, that isn't the case. It just happens that there are plenty of
fundamental problems in logic that are unsolved - or, at least, not in
consensus.

# The normative status of logic

# Does logic really deal with some formalization of natural language? is it supposed to deal with it?

I'm not sure how fundamental a question that is, but just seems like a
good starting point.

## On the many problems of implication

## On the many non-classical logics

# Is logic exceptional? The non-exceptionality of logic

# Is there something worth the name of "the one true logic"?

# Why study logic(s)
